# GameTime
Game Time is an Android app that lets follow NBA results, teams and players. 
This app was made as part of the student project at SFSU. 
Main goal was to try out some cutting edge technologies, like how RxJava works with Retrofit. 
Another great thing about this project is that it uses the Kotlin language.
